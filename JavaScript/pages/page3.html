                    In medieval times, human beings used to live in small societies. They used to live, 
                    eat and hunt in pairs and their outreach was limited too. Connecting with the outer
                     world was a distant dream. But after so many technological advancements with introduction
                      of internet, the whole scenario has changed. Right now, you can connect with anyone putting up in
                       different corner of the world with just a click of a mouse. Introduction of internet was one of the best 
                       inventions, we can think of. And with the introduction of internet, we have seen the evolution of a new species
                        called "Bloggers". They are the type of species who have tried to outrun this information world with their vast 
                        informative articles. From product reviews, travel ideas, current and breaking news, technological advancements they
                         are everywhere. This new era of 'Blogosphere' has created a bunch of new bloggers adn websites, which tell us about new
                          technological advancements, Softwares, Applications, Recovery and Repair manuals and so on.
